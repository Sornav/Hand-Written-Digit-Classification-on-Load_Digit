# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification-on-Load_Digit
Hand Written digit recognition on Load_digit data set by using Kth Nearest Neighbor Algorithm with implementation from scratch and plots.I made this project to learn how to implement Kth Nearest Neighbor from scratch without using Sklearn. First I built my own KNN function and classified my data,then I used the Sklearn library to classify the data and then compared my predictions with the results predicted by Sklearn and also visualized the comparison graph ,also implemented the Train_Test_Split function from scratch.

**Note:I usually visualize my data by using Plotly Library,so if you are having trouble viewing them in the GitHub viewer, you are free to clone my repository on your local machine and check them out in jupyter notebook,other wise follow the step below.
